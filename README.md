Project description
We work with a corpus of English words. Our task is to design an efficient data structure (e.g. BST, hash table) to implement a dictionary ADT that has the following operations.

# OPERATIONS
1.Populate a dictionary with a given text file.
2.Look up a word’s definition.
3.Insert a new word and its definition.
4.Delete a word and its definition.
5.Suggest another word given an incorrectly spelled word.
6.Generate a specified length story given an initial seed in the dictionary by only using the words in the current dictionary.
